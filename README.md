# BarebonesUI
Simplify your UI!

I made this for myself at first but i thoght some others might like it so ive uploaded it here. Ive slightly edited the Minecraft bedrock ui to make it match with the bare bones theam, now with my custom textures there are still some minecraft textures i have yet to change (good luck finding them) and some of robots bare bones textures which some of his i have edited too

Also Robot if your reading this your fully welcome to have these textures for barebones as ive also fixed some of the bugs with your pack IE: the xp bar and hunger bar
